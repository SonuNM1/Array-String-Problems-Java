### Stack based Problems 

- Implement Stack using Queues

 Implement a stack using two queues.

- Valid Parentheses
 
 Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

- Min Stack
 Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

- Next Greater Element
 
 Given an array, find the next greater element for each element. The next greater element for an element is the first element to its right which is greater than it.

- Remove Outermost Parentheses
 
 Given a valid parentheses string, remove the outermost parentheses of every primitive string.

- Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
 
 Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).

- Backspace String Compare
 
 Given two strings `S` and `T`, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.

- Daily Temperatures
 
 Given a list of daily temperatures, return a list where each day indicates how many days you'd have to wait until a warmer temperature.

- Implement a Stack
 
 Implement a basic stack with `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `isEmpty` operations.

- Reverse a String Using Stack
 
 Given a string, reverse it using a stack.

### Queue- Based Problems


- Implement Queue using Stacks
 
 Implement a queue using two stacks.

- Design Circular Queue
 
 Design a circular queue with operations like `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `isFull`, and `isEmpty`.

- Number of Recent Calls
 
 Implement a class that counts the number of recent calls within a certain time frame using a queue.

- Implement a Queue
 
 Implement a basic queue with `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `peek`, and `isEmpty` operations.

- Moving Average from Data Stream
 
 Given a stream of integers, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

- Sliding Window Maximum
 
 Given an array and an integer `k`, find the maximum element in each sliding window of size `k`.

- First Unique Character in a String
 
 Given a string, find the first non- repeating character using a queue.

- Course Schedule (BFS Approach)
 
 Given a list of courses and their prerequisites, determine if you can finish all courses. Use a queue to perform BFS for topological sorting.

- Perfect Number Check Using Queue
 
 Use a queue to generate the first few perfect numbers and check if a given number is perfect.

- Interleave the First Half of the Queue with the Second Half
 
 Given a queue of integers, interleave the first half of the queue with the second half.
