 - Check if a String is a Subsequence (order same, contiguous not necessary) of Another String. ✅ 

    Given two strings, check if the first string is a subsequence of the second.

 - Check if a String is a Substring (contiguous) of Another String  ✅

 No, subsequence and substring are not the same thing. Here's the difference:

 A subsequence is a sequence derived from another string by deleting some or none of the characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

Example: For the string `"abcde"`:

   `"ace"` is a subsequence.
   `"abc"` is a subsequence.
   `"de"` is a subsequence.
   `"aed"` is not a subsequence because the order of characters is changed.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. The characters must appear consecutively in the original string.

Example: For the string `"abcde"`:

   `"abc"` is a substring.
   `"cde"` is a substring.
   `"bcd"` is a substring.
   `"ace"` is not a substring because the characters are not consecutive.

Key Difference:

Order: In a subsequence, the order of characters must be maintained, but they do not need to be consecutive.

Contiguity: A substring requires the characters to be contiguous (consecutive) in the original string, while a subsequence does not.
