- Kth largest element in the array 

- Kth smallest element in the array 

- Kth Largest Element in a Stream

- Last Stone Weight
    
   You are given an array of stones' weights. At each turn, we select the two heaviest stones and smash them together. The result is that the heaviest stone reduces in weight, or both stones are destroyed. Return the weight of the last remaining stone.

- K Closest Points to Origin
   
   Given an array of points in a 2D plane, find the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

- Top K Frequent Elements
   
   Given an integer array, return the `k` most frequent elements. You can solve this by using a heap to keep track of frequencies.

- Merge K Sorted Lists
   
   Given `k` sorted linked lists, merge them into one sorted linked list. A min-heap can be used to efficiently merge the lists.

- Find Median from Data Stream
   
   Design a data structure that supports adding numbers and finding the median of the numbers added so far. You can solve this problem using two heaps (a max-heap and a min-heap).

- Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists
   
   Given `k` lists of sorted integers, find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the `k` lists.

- Sort Characters By Frequency
   
   Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters. You can use a heap to sort based on frequency.

- Reorganize String
    
    Given a string, rearrange the characters such that no two adjacent characters are the same. If possible, return any valid arrangement. If not, return an empty string.

- Kth Smallest Element in a Matrix
    
    Given an `n x n` matrix where each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, find the `kth` smallest element in the matrix.

- Kth Smallest Element in a BST
    
    Given a binary search tree, write a function to find the `kth` smallest element in it.

- Min Cost to Connect Ropes
    
    You are given `n` ropes, and the cost to connect two ropes is equal to the sum of their lengths. Connect all the ropes into one rope with the minimum cost. This problem can be solved efficiently using a heap.

- Reduce Array Size to The Half
    
    Given an array, reduce its size by half by removing the fewest number of elements possible. Return the number of elements you need to remove.

- Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums
    
    Given two sorted arrays, find the `k` pairs `(u,v)` such that the sum of `u + v` is the smallest.

- Task Scheduler
    
    Given a list of tasks, each task takes one unit of time to execute. You are given a cooldown interval after which the same task can be executed again. Find the minimum time needed to finish all tasks.

- Smallest Kth Number
    
    Given a list of numbers, find the `kth` smallest number using a min-heap.

- Minimum Number of Refueling Stops
    
    A car travels from a starting position to a destination. Along the way, it may stop at gas stations to refuel. Determine the minimum number of refueling stops needed to reach the destination.

- Top K Frequent Words
    
    Given a list of words, return the `k` most frequent words in descending order. You can use a heap to maintain the top `k` words by frequency.

- Relative Ranks
    
    Given scores of athletes, return their relative ranks and the people with the top three highest scores, who will be awarded medals: "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", and "Bronze Medal".
